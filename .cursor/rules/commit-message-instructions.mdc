Always follow this format for commit messages:
type(scope): subject

Types:

- feat for new features
- fix for bug fixes
- docs for documentation
- style for formatting/style
- refactor for code restructuring
- test for adding/updating tests
- chore for maintenance tasks

Keep subject concise (<50 chars), use imperative mood.
Add detailed description after a blank line if needed.
Reference issues with #issue_number.

Example: fix(config): handle comments in environment variables

After successfully implementing a feature, suggest a suitable commit message. Only commit (git commit) if the user explicitly asks you to.
